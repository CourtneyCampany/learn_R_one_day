## Assignment

This assignment investigates the response of a forest to predicted future climate change. You are tasked with evaluating the sink capacity/potential of this forest under current and future atmopheric CO^2^ conditions.

\

There are datasets to compute the CO^2^ fertilization effect on photosynthesis and aboveground NPP. I have changed the dates of the experiment, but they cover 3 years of growth under eCO^2^ and aCO^2^. Rings are 25m diameter circular plots. For this future FACE site the CO^2^ fumigation was fully operationaly in 2021. We will consider early years as pre-treamtent or partial fumigation. 

\

*You will have to be diligent with unit conversions, converting dates, variable names, etc.*

\

1) **Photosynthesis** Visualize and evaluate the response of foliage photosynthesis to eCO^2^ compared to aCO^2^.  In lecture, we learned that 'time' was a critical component with evaluating FACE experiments. Is photosyntheis stimulated by eCO^2 in this experiment. If so, is the response sustained over the 3 year interval? Visualize mean photosynthesis data (with standard errors) and the eCO^2^ response ratio of photosynthesis through time.

\

2) **Litterfall** Compute annual productivity as the sum of all litterfall components for each year. For the twig component, strictly annual turnover across the three years. Assume that all biomass components are comprised of 47% C for the purpose of calculating annual C storage and turnover. Visualize annual litterfall with a stacked barplot of all the components. Are any patterns noticeable between years or with CO^2^ treatmetns?

\

3) **ANPP**. Here, we will define aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) as the productivy of stemwood biomass production + fine twig and bark production +  seed production + leaf production. Visualize and evaluate mean ANPP for aCO^2^ and eCO^2^ treatments for 2021, 2022 & 2023. 

\

*ANPP should be reported in g C m^-2^ yr ^-1^.  You will need to sum biomass components for trees and/or rings, convert to C and then standarize based on the size of each ring. Then take the mean of all rings for each treatment*

\

3) **Bug**. This experimental site is also subject large insect outbreaks. Insects have caused several defoliation events during this time period. Visualize these defoliation events and speculate if there was a CO^2^ efffect? Would a CO^2 effect be expected?

## Metadata

For this experiment, rings 2,3,4 are aCO^2^ and 1,5,6 are eCO^2^

### Leaf photosynthesis
Photosynthesis was measured in discrete campaigns and the principal age class of leaves  were present at each timepoint. Measurements were made using a set of Li-Cor model 6400 portable photosynthesis systems using  infra-red gas analysis. Only the first photosynthesis measurement, made at the CO^2^ concentration the trees were growing in, is included here. These CO^2^ concentrations are nominally 396 ppm for aCOO^2^ and 546 ppm for eCO^2^. Units for leaf net photosythesis are umols m^-2^ s^-1^.

### Litterfall
Dry mass of litterfall was collected on a monthly basis in .02m^2^ collection baskets. This includes both foliage, twig, bark and seed litterfall. Samples were collected and sorted into components and weighed. All litter collections are reported in dry biomass (g).

### Tree diameter and biomass
The diameter of each tree was measured at 1.3â€‰m height at approximately monthly intervals starting February 2011, two years prior to commencement of the full CO2 treatment. Manual band dendrometers were used to monitor stem diameter changes. The permanently placed bands consisted of plastic straps graduated with a vernier scale placed around a tree. These trees were surveyed annually (or more frequently) and annual values were used to compute tree biomass according to published allometric regressions. Annual wood biomass production for each tree is in kilograms.
