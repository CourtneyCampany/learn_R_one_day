###Using the allometry dataset I would like you to explore relationships in tree biomass allocation
###ignore belowground data (there is way more aboveground data to play with)

### This dataset includes:
### 1. tree biomass of different compoents,
### 2. Area and density of of difference structural compnents (sapwood area)
### 3. Leaf area, leaf mass, LMA (thickness) and crown dimensions
### 4. Tree age and height
### 5. Limited data on nitrogen content of tree components

### First look for broad patterns, visualize where relationships exists
### You may have to plot on log scale if variation in data is large

### Then...You have a wealth of factors to explore including:
### Species, Plant functional type, Ecosystem Type, Growing environment and Climate


### Remember that mass fractions might be just as interesting as comparing biomass among components
### How much biomass is allocated to a component (as part of the total) shifts with ontogeny

###Hendrik Poorter has 2 papers which might help with this concept (2012/2015).

#I am giving you two weeks for this assignment, for several reasons:
#1) We have presentations next week.
#2) This is our first data exercise, so you will need a buffer
#3) However, with the extra time I want a little more.....


###Please produce a Markdown file with 5 publication quality figures
###There is no requirement on the type of figures

###You are free to explore the data as broadly (all trees) or as narrow (plant type) 
###as you would like

###Intrepret what report! You can interpret each individual figure 
###or build a story around your findings

### REMEMBER you are being graded on both the quality of the figures and your intepretation
### See grading rubric on Moodle
### Although coloboration is encrouraged I still want to see indivudal work, so....
### There is the potential for one bonus point for the best figure by one person.
