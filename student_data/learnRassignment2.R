### Learn R assignment #2

### using the combined class data generate 3 publication quality figures
### explore different relationships that may or may not be present in the data

### produce at least one scatterplot and one boxplot

### interpret the results of your data exploration and plotting 
### a few sentences per figure is fine
### it may make sense to focus on one set of categorical values

### Turn in your assignment as a markdown file (.Rmd) with 'word' as the output
### Make sure and write a caption for each figure
### use echo=FALSE in the code chunk, I can turn it on later

###post any issues in Slack
