###Mystery Data #3: Colorado Floods

###This assignments contains serveral datasets that you will have to manipulate, 
###format, subset and intrepret together

###To examine a 1-100yr flood in Colorado we will look at precipitation, stream gauge
###and climate data for the watershed in which the flood occured.

###This assigment is different from previous mystery data exercises
###Here, we will visualize and intrepret data to understand the factors that 
###lead to this flood and generate and industry style report on what you find


#1) Plot the complete precipation data from NOAA for the Colorado Basin by month
#2) Visualize the specific extreme flooding that occurred in Boulder, Colorado in 2013
    #Make sure you date is in the proper format
    #You will have to set a Nodata value to 'NA'

#3) Investigate and intepret any the patterns in precipitation leading up ito the flood

#4) Plot stream discharge for the flooding event and discuss your findings in acc


#5) Investigate the severity (or lack thereof) of drought in Colorado 
#before the 2013 floods with the Palmer Drought Index (PDSI)
  #a) Were the months leading up to the September 2013 floods a drought?
  #b) what is the historical legacy of "wet" and "dry" years in the area

##What is the correct watershed for Boulder area? (CO-04 Platte River Drainage)
#6) The CLIMDIV dataset includes several other measures of precipitation, drought, 
# and temperature. Visualize and these variables reveal any interesting patterns
# regarding the  boulder floods. Choose 1 to make an additional figure.

#station located in central Boulder, CO: 050843

###The heavy precipitation (rain) that occurred in September 2013 caused much damage
###during the 2013 flood by, among other things, increasing stream discharge (flow).
