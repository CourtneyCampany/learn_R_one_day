### Using the global leaf area dataset I would like you to explore patterns in species 
### leaf size by plant functional type, leaf type, location and/or climate variables.

### This dataset includes mean leaf area (cm2) for a huge variety of species
### What is super cool is the incredible range of actual leaf sizes that exist!!!

### The plotting in this assingnment is more straightforward than the allometry dataset,
### as your y axis will always be leaf area (cm2).

### Now that you knowledge of ecosystems is increasing, I expect more from you intrepretation
### I want to see insight into why you think patterns in plant leaf size are occurring.

###  For this assingment I would like at least 4 figures, including a map of the distribution
###  of samples leaves.
