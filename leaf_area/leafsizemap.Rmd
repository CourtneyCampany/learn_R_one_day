## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r maps, echo=FALSE}
library(maps)
leaves<-read.csv("leafarea_global.csv")

map('world')
points(leaves$Longitude, leaves$Latitude, cex=sqrt(leaves$Leaf.size_cm2/1000),
       pch=21, bg="dodgerblue")

```
